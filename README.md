# Urban Green Spaces in Major Cities

## Project Overview

This GeoNarrative project provides an interactive exploration of urban green spaces across major cities worldwide. With engrossing stories, thought-provoking maps, and visually arresting components, it emphasizes the significance of these locations in urban contexts. Public gardens and large parks are examples of urban green spaces. Among their many benefits are biodiversity enhancement, improved community mental health, and decreased influence on urban heat islands. This campaign aims to raise public awareness of the significance of protecting and enhancing these vital urban resources.

**Features:**
- Interactive maps showcasing the distribution of green spaces in urban settings.
- Detailed narratives that uncover the story of urban greenery and its significance.
- A visual journey through various cities, illustrating the beauty and utility of green spaces.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML5 for structure.
- CSS3 for styling, with a focus on layout, responsiveness, and visual appeal.
- JavaScript for interactivity, with particular emphasis on map manipulation and scroll-driven storytelling.
- Mapbox GL JS for dynamic, interactive mapping capabilities.
- Scrollama.js for implementing narrative-driven scroll interactions.

**Objective:**
to educate and inspire people about the value of green spaces in urban environments and to support their expansion and maintenance. Through this project, we seek to show how important urban green spaces are for both aesthetically pleasant and sustainable urban living.

The fundamental relevance of green areas to our urban ecosystems, social welfare, and environmental health is brought to light by this research. Our goal is to stimulate action towards the creation of more resilient, healthful, and green urban settings for future generations by investigating the green heart of cities.
